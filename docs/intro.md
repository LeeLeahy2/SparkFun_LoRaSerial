# Introduction

Out of the box, the SparkFun LoRaSerial products are simple-to-use serial radios and can be used with little or no configuration. This Product Manual provides detailed descriptions of all the available features of the LoRaSerial products.

The line of LoRaSerial products offered by SparkFun all run identical firmware. The [LoRaSerial repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_LoRaSerial) and this guide cover the following products:
