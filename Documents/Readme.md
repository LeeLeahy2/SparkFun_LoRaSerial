LoRaSerial Documents and Airspeed Calculations
========================================

[![SparkFun LoRaSerial Airspeed Spreadsheet](../docs/img/SparkFun%20LoRaSerial%20Airspeed%20Spreadsheet.png)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qyJa3ldE-KDUHwHNSctBMccPTVRwKbmAsodkdvOc3-8/edit?usp=sharing)

The available airspeeds (400 to 19200) used in LoRaSerial were picked to, as closely as possible, mimic modem baud rates. Other spread factors, bandwidths, and coding rates can be used if desired.

[This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qyJa3ldE-KDUHwHNSctBMccPTVRwKbmAsodkdvOc3-8/edit?usp=sharing) can be used to inspect the airtime formulas.

Additionally, this folder contains the various datasheets for the SX1276 IC, common to all LoRaSerial modules, as well as the individual datasheets for the different module types (915, 868, 433, etc).
